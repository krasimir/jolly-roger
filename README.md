## Concept

The [hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) is a wonderful idea. There are some slick patterns involved which pushes the React development to a more functional approach. I was really interesting to try that new API and decided to use it for my [latest project](https://igit.dev). It looked like I can't really build my app only with hooks. I needed something else. And that's mainly because every hook works on a local component level. I can't really transfer state.
